**Full project:** [Published on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Gretapoc/Socio-Economic-Analysis-of-Countries)

**Description:** The objective of this study is to analyze the socio-economic data of countries worldwide and classify them based on similarities and differences using relevant statistical methods. The dataset used for this study is sourced from the 2019 World Bank databases and has been thoroughly cleaned and organized. The statistical analysis involves several methods, including principal component analysis, hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis, and hypothesis testing.

**Results:** Through the application of statistical methods, distinct clusters of countries were identified based on economic and social factors, and the geographic position of countries within each cluster played a role in their similarities and differences. Further analysis revealed outliers, including Chad and India, and hypotheses were tested to investigate gender differences in suicide rates and life expectancy.
